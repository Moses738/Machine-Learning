Dear students of Gudlavalleru Engineering College,

I am pleased to inform you that I have uploaded all the tutorial notebooks that I made during our machine learning classes to this platform. These notebooks serve as a valuable reference material and I hope they will be of great help to you in your learning.

If anyone are new to machine learning and want to start learning, you can also use these notebooks as a starting point. They are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject and cover all the necessary topics.

If you have any questions or would like to add personal topics or improve the code, please feel free to reach out to me. I am always happy to help and support you in any way I can.

Thank you and happy learning!
